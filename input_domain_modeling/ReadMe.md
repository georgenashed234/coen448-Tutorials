### ECC (Each Choice Coverage) and BCC (Base Choice Coverage)
are input space partitioning (ISP) criteria used to determine which combinations of input values to select when testing, aiming to reduce a large input domain into a manageable, finite set of test cases. 

### Each Choice Coverage (ECC)
Definition: Requires that at least one value from each block (partition) for each characteristic (parameter) be used in at least one test case.
Goal: To ensure every partition is exercised at least once, providing a very weak but efficient form of coverage.
Test Generation: The number of tests required is determined by the maximum number of blocks among all characteristics.
Strengths: Very low cost and few test cases, suitable for initial testing.
Weaknesses: Might miss important combinations of inputs because it only guarantees individual coverage, not interaction. 

### Base Choice Coverage (BCC)
Definition: Requires that a "base choice" (usually the most nominal or common value) is chosen for each characteristic, forming a base test case. Subsequent tests are created by holding all but one base choice constant and varying the remaining parameter to one of its other values.
Goal: To test the most common scenarios thoroughly while varying one parameter at a time.

Strengths: More robust than ECC because it focuses on combinations around a "normal" case, often used to test the "happy path" and its direct variations.
Weaknesses: Requires more tests than ECC and requires knowledge of which inputs constitute a "base" case. 

### Key Differences
Approach: ECC picks arbitrary values from each block to meet minimal coverage. BCC requires picking a specific "base" value for each parameter.
Test Set Size: ECC generally results in fewer tests than BCC.
Effectiveness: BCC is typically more effective than ECC at finding bugs because it tests combinations of input variations rather than just individual partitions.

# Acceptance Criteria for isBipartite(int[][] graph)

## Valid Inputs
1. **Empty graph**: `graph = []` → return `true` (vacuously bipartite)
2. **Single node, no edges**: `graph = [[]]` → return `true`
3. **Two nodes, one edge**: `graph = [[1], [0]]` → return `true`
4. **Bipartite graph (even cycle)**: `graph = [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]` (4-node cycle) → return `true`
5. **Non-bipartite graph (odd cycle)**: `graph = [[1,2], [0,2], [0,1]]` (3-node triangle) → return `false`
6. **Disconnected bipartite**: Multiple connected components, all bipartite → return `true`
7. **Disconnected non-bipartite**: At least one component is not bipartite → return `false`
8. **Self-loop**: `graph = [[0]]` (node 0 connected to itself) → return `false`
9. **Complete bipartite graph**: K_{m,n} where all nodes in set A connect to all in set B → return `true`
10. **Large graph**: 1000+ nodes → return correct result

## Invalid Inputs
1. **Null graph**: `graph = null` → throw `NullPointerException`
2. **Null adjacency list**: `graph = [[1], null, [0]]` → throw `NullPointerException`
3. **Invalid node index**: `graph = [[5], [0]]` where node 5 doesn't exist → throw `IndexOutOfBoundsException`
4. **Negative node index**: `graph = [[-1], [0]]` → throw `IllegalArgumentException`
5. **Duplicate edges**: `graph = [[1,1], [0,0]]` → should handle gracefully (may be treated as single edge)

## Exception Types
- `NullPointerException`: null input or null adjacency lists
- `IndexOutOfBoundsException`: node indices out of valid range [0, graph.length)
- `IllegalArgumentException`: negative or invalid node indices
